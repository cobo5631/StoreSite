# StoreSite
website for small restaurant 

Once logged in, users will be taken to a page that displays the menu; at the bottom will be a button with value "make an order".
This button will direct them to a page that has the items on the menu from which they will choose item and amount. 
A the bottom of this page is another button with value "place order" and another with value "cancel order".

I would like to do something similar to the pizza time wireframe.
